# 🧬 Conway’s Game of Life - *Vibe-Coded*

Hey there! 👋
This is a fun little side project where I vibe-coded a version of the classic **Game of Life** in Python:
I asked different AI coding assistants to help me generate the code.

## ✨ What is it?

**Conway’s Game of Life** is a famous zero-player game - you set it up and just watch how the cells live, die, and evolve based on simple rules.
It’s like a tiny digital petri dish for beautiful, endless patterns.

---

## 🤖 Why AI-generated?

I was curious.
As of now, I have:
* 🟢 One version with **Gemini**
* 🔵 One version with **Claude**

They each have their quirks, different styles, and some bugs.

---

## 🏗️ Not perfect yet!

These versions aren’t perfect.
They might have rough edges, missing features, or weird bugs.
This is just a playground for me to experiment

I plan to keep tweaking both versions whenever I get the chance.

## 🚀 How to run it

1. **Clone this repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sidd-Rai/GameOfLife.git
   ```

2. **Install Python** (3.8+ recommended) and any dependencies listed in each version’s instructions.

3. **Run either version!**

   * `python gGameOfLife_Gemini.py`
   * `python GameOfLife_Claude.py`

4. Sit back and watch your cells do their thing. ✨

## 💌 Thanks for stopping by!

Feel free to fork it, break it, fix it, or make it your own.
One day, I’ll come back and polish it up!
