# 🧬 Conway’s Game of Life: *Vibe-Coded*

Hey there! 👋
This is a fun little side project where I vibe-coded a version of the classic **Game of Life** in Python.
I asked different AI coding assistants to help me generate the code, mixed and matched the best elements and settled on a final version.

## ✨ What is it?

**Conway’s Game of Life** is a famous zero-player game - you set it up and just watch how the cells live, die and evolve based on simple rules.
It’s like a tiny digital petri dish for beautiful, endless patterns.

## 🔢 Rules of the Game

Each cell on the grid follows these simple rules every generation:

1. **Underpopulation:** Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
2. **Survival:** Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on.
3. **Overpopulation:** Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
4. **Reproduction:** Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

## 🤖 Why AI-generated?

I was bored and well.. curious.

As of now, I have used elements generated by:

* 🟢 **ChatGPT**
* 🟢 **Gemini**
* 🟢 **Claude**

They each have their quirks, different styles, and some bugs.

## 🏗️ Not perfect yet!

These versions aren’t perfect.
They might have rough edges, missing features, or weird bugs.
This is just a playground for me to experiment.

I plan to keep tweaking both versions whenever I get the chance.

## 🚀 How to run it

1. **Clone this repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sidd-Rai/GameOfLife.git
   ```

2. **Install Python** (3.8+ recommended) and any dependencies listed in each version’s instructions.

3. **Run the game**

   * `python GameOfLife.py`

4. Sit back and watch your cells do their thing. ✨

## 💌 Thanks for stopping by!

Feel free to fork it, break it, fix it, or make it your own.
One day, I’ll come back and polish it up!
